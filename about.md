# About this project
Project developed in R to study the different sentiments appearing in songs depending on their procedence country, based on the hypothesis that Spanish songs' general theme is love or happiness. It has been motivated by a Computer science's degree subject in Madrid's Computense University.

We are 3 students from the last years of study, deeply interested in Big Data and exploring the different techniques to work with such a big quantity of data.
